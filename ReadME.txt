jQuery plugins:
 - DataTables
 - Initially I was thinking my modal for 'people' counted as a plugin
    but after reviewing my code I realized too late that that's not the case
    
    
When developing the courses on demand feature for a minor's class, I thought it
would be a good idea to use javascript for that feature. I realized too late
that I have a CORS blocker plugin in my browser that made this feature work. Without
the CORS blocker, that feature will not work properly. That is a mistake on my end.
